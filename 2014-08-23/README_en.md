## 2014 Autumn Tech Conference
On Aug 23, we held first Tech Conference since the establishment of Harbin Linux User Group. Although there was a heavy rain, 12 people attended.  
The first topic provided by Zhenbo Li was about [Wine & GSoC][s1]. This topic includes his experience on Wine project, and suggestions for Google Summer of Code. His short speech was full of laughter.
